These are just a collection of useful python functions, separated in files according to the application area:
  -amber_utils.py : helper functions to create amber input files, run simulations on a cluster using slurm, analyze amber output files, etc.
  -redes_utils.py : helper functions to prepare data, train and test pytorch neural networks
  -sequence_utils.py : helper functions for working with DNA and protein sequences, things like creating/mutating sequences, getting base or aminoacid frequences, loading fasta files.
